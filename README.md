WTF Is this?
============

This is a frankenstinian combination of the fantastic [Heroku NodeJS buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)
and [Leafo's similarly fantastic Lua buildpack](https://github.com/leafo/heroku-buildpack-lua)

There is literally no reason you should use this pack over either the NodeJS
or Lua packs unless you, like me, need to shell out to Lua from NodeJS.
